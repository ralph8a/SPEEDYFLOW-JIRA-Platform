Proxies declare flows (Request/Response) and attach policies. - Flow: ordered sequence of steps (policies, scripts, service callouts) that run for requests and responses. - Policies: declarative building blocks used to implement security, mediation, transformation, caching, quotas and analytics. Examples: OAuth2, VerifyJWT, SpikeArrest, Quota, JSONThreatProtection, AssignMessage, PopulateCache, ServiceCallout. - Environment: runtime container where proxies are deployed (dev, test, prod, pay-as-you-go environment types). - Shared flows: reusable sequences that can be attached to multiple proxies for cross-cutting concerns (logging, auth). - Developer portal: portal to onboard API consumers, publish API docs, manage keys and product subscriptions.",auth

Use declarative policies whenever possible (less custom code → easier maintenance). 2. Keep security policies near the start of the request flow. 3. Use analytics for baselining and anomaly detection before setting strict quotas. 4. Use shared flows for cross-cutting concerns (auth, telemetry, error handling). 5. Monitor latency and error budgets; protect backends with rate limits and circuit-breaker patterns (ServiceCallout + RaiseFault).",auth

Example pattern: when ML comment-suggester flags a ""timeout spike"", query Problems API for correlating CPU/latency anomalies in the incident window and attach top 3 problem IDs to the ticket. - Traces and distributed context: Use the Trace API to retrieve individual spans and to map slow traces to service endpoints. Correlate trace IDs found in logs with Dynatrace traces to assemble a timeline. - Custom metrics & tagging: Push business metrics (e.g., ticket_count, sla_breach_count) to Dynatrace via the Metrics API. Use consistent tag keys (project, queue, environment) so dashboards and Davis insights group correctly. - Synthetic monitoring: configure synthetic HTTP/browser monitors for critical flows (login, checkout, API health). When a synthetic monitor fails, automatically create a JIRA incident with synthetic test details and link to the run. - Log analytics: forward structured logs (JSON) and use auto-extracted attributes. Dynatrace can link logs to traces and problems via traceId and entity IDs; ensure your log format includes traceId and spanId. - Alerting & remediation runbooks: attach a short runbook link (from docs/playbooks) to problems and add automated remediation steps (e.g., scale-up, restart service) using webhooks or Automations API.","timeout,auth,sla"
