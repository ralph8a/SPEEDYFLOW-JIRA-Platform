What is OTT?
------------
Over-the-top (OTT) services deliver audio/video content over the public Internet without using managed pay-TV or cable distribution. OTT models include streaming platforms (SVOD), free-ad-supported (FAST), and live skinny bundles.
Technical building blocks
------------------------
- CDN: Content Delivery Networks for edge caching and low latency delivery.
- Streaming protocols: HLS, DASH for adaptive bitrate streaming.
- DRM: Widevine/PlayReady/FairPlay for content protection.
- Analytics: real-time telemetry to detect buffering, bitrate switches, concurrent viewers.
- Personalization: recommendation engines, A/B experimentation, user profiles.
Operational patterns
--------------------
- Scale for peaks (sporting events): autoscaling, multi-CDN strategies, pre-warming caches.
- Monitor rebuffering ratio and startup time; set SLOs and alert thresholds.
- Use adaptive bitrate with device/network-aware profiles for best QoE.
Relevance to SPEEDYFLOW
-----------------------
- If integrating OTT notifications or ticketing for streaming incidents, capture telemetry (region, CDN, error codes) in tickets; use ML models to map errors → likely root causes (CDN/Origin/Encoding).
