Overview
--------
Telcel is Mexico's largest mobile network operator (subsidiary of América Móvil) providing GSM/3G/4G/5G services, voice, SMS, mobile data and value-added services. For OTT and API integration, Telcel functions as the network/carrier that delivers traffic to end-users and may provide partner APIs for billing or provisioning in commercial agreements.
Network & Technical Notes
-------------------------
- Radio technologies: GSM, UMTS (3G), HSPA+, LTE (4G), VoLTE/VoWiFi and emerging 5G deployments.
- Connectivity concerns for OTT: mobile data throughput, latency, packet loss, and metered/bundled plans affecting user experience.
- Carrier partnerships: Telcel can bundle OTT services into plans (zero-rating), which may require commercial and technical integration.
Integration patterns
--------------------
- For OTT providers: monitor mobile QoS (latency, throughput) per region and adapt bitrate/codec accordingly.
- For API integrations with carriers: use well-defined RESTful APIs (provisioning, billing) behind an API management layer (Apigee) with mutual TLS / OAuth and strict rate limits.
