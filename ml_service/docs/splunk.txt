Overview
--------
Splunk is a platform for searching, monitoring, and analyzing machine-generated data (logs, metrics, events). Supports powerful search language (SPL), dashboards, alerts, and integrations.

Key Concepts
------------
- Indexes: store time-series event data.
- SPL (Search Processing Language): query language for filtering, aggregations, and transformations.
- Forwarders: ship logs to Splunk indexers.
- Dashboards/Alerts: create visualizations and trigger alerts.

Useful SPL Patterns
-------------------
- Search error rates in last 15 min:
  index=app_logs level=ERROR | timechart count by service span=1m
- Find occurrences of HTTP 500 and top endpoints:
  index=app_logs "500" | stats count by uri | sort -count
- Correlate logs by trace id:
  index=app_logs trace_id=abc123 | table _time service message

Integration Patterns
--------------------
- When a ticket mentions an error code, run a Splunk search for that code within the incident window and attach results or link to the dashboard.
- Use Splunk alerts to create JIRA tickets via webhook for critical incidents.
