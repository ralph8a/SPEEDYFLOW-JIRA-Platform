Overview
--------
Dynatrace is an APM and observability platform for monitoring applications, infrastructure, and user experience. Key features: full-stack monitoring, distributed traces, metrics, logs, synthetic monitoring, real-user monitoring (RUM), AI-driven root cause analysis (Davis).

Key Concepts
------------
- OneAgent: automatic instrumentation agent for hosts and containers.
- Davis AI: automated problem detection and root cause analysis.
- Dynatrace Metrics / Custom Metrics: ingest application and infrastructure metrics.
- Traces: distributed tracing for request flows across services.
- Log monitoring: ingest logs and connect to traces for context.

APIs & Integrations
-------------------
- Metrics API: push metrics to Dynatrace.
- Events API: send custom events/annotations.
- Problems API: query detected problems.
- Logs ingest API: ship logs via HTTP or collectors.

Patterns for SPEEDYFLOW
----------------------
- Use OneAgent in staging/prod to collect traces and map slow transactions to tickets.
- When comment patterns indicate "timeout" or "500", query Dynatrace Problems and Traces for related timestamps and attach summaries to the ticket.
- Enrich tickets with Dynatrace problem IDs and URLs for quick investigation.
